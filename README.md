## Game Instructions

This game is a play off the classic frogger game with a human player and pesky cockroaches as your enemy!

###### Game Objective
Move your player from the safe zone (grass) through enemy territory without colliding with any cockroaches.

###### How to Win
If you successfully make it across to the water you will score a point and win that round against the cockroaches! If you fail to make it across you will receive a cockroach collision.
